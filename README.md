# Android Widgets
The sole reason for creating these widgets is because of my astrophotography hobby. 

## ☁️ Cloud Widget

Cloud widget shows the cloud cover in a set location. I love to stargaze and having a low cloud cover increases star view. I got annoyed that I always have to look out the window to check for clear skies, hence the widget.

## 🌙 Moon Phase Widget

Just thought it would be cool to have my own widget to display the Moon Phase, when it sets and rise; just so I can moon gaze.<br>
Besides, star gazing / astrophotography also works best during new moon, lowering the light pollution reflected by the moon 

## 🎵 Spotify Player Widget

I made this because I did not like the design of the official Spotify's widget. My widget can not only control the music, but also change the background dynamically according to the album's art colours.
